## Why?
I use certain starter kits again and again. But it's a hassle to keep them bookmarked, to find them when required and then clone to a directory.

**Kickstart** will remember them and clone to the desired directory for you with a single command. Though kickstart is all about remembering a git repo and cloning it to a directory, use it for anything you like.

## Installation
```
$ npm install kick-start -g
```


Clone a starter kit to the **current working directory**
```
kick
```


Add a new starter kit
```
kick -a
```

Remove a start kit
```
kick -r
```
